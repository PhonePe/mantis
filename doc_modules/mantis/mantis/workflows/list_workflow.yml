      The executor method handles two main listing operations:
      
      1. List Organizations (when args.list_orgs is True):
         - Logs an info message about retrieving organizations
         - Calls get_orgs() asynchronously to fetch all organizations
         - If organizations are found:
           * Prints the total count of organizations
           * Prints each organization name on a new line
         - If no organizations are found:
           * Logs an info message indicating no organizations were found
      
      2. List Domains (when args.list_domains is True):
         - Logs an info message about retrieving subdomains
         - Calls get_domains() with filtering parameters:
           * Organizations list
           * Asset types list
           * Date range filters (before and after)
         - If domains are found:
           * Prints the organizations filter being used
           * Prints total count of domains found
           * Prints each domain on a new line
         - If no domains are found:
           * Logs an info message indicating no domains were found
      
      Edge Cases:
      - Handles empty results for both organizations and domains
      - Can process multiple organizations in the filter
      - Handles date range filtering for domains
      - Both list operations can be requested in the same execution
      - Filters can be empty or contain multiple values
