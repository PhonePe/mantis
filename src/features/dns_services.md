# Integrate DNS Services

<product-team>product security teams</product-team>

## ðŸ¤” Use-Case
**I want to:**
- *feed my known assets to the framework because I know that they belong to my organization*
- *have the capability to feed subdomains, IP, IP-CIDRs or IP Range*
- *integrate my organisation's DNS Service*

## ðŸ˜ƒ Feature

We are aware that **no recon automation framework can be perfect** in identifying all assets and findings. To some extent, this also depends on the tools used. Therefore, we designed Mantis to not only provide an external attacker's perspective but also **add internal context** to an organization.

There are two ways in which you can add internal context to Mantis:

- Integrate your DNS Service (Route 53)
- Upload a file (use the '-f' flag)
