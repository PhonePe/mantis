## ðŸ¤” Use-Case
**I want to:**
- *identify any secrets belonging to my organization that have been leaked on the public internet*
- *identify any secrets that have been provided by my organization to our partners or vendors that have been leaked on the public internet*


## ðŸ˜ƒ Feature

> INFOðŸ’¡: Secrets scanning is currently an experimental feature due to a number of limitations, such as rate limiting that are applied on the search engines where we search for information.

The basic responsibility of secrets scanning is to **identify secrets on the public internet**. Currently, it searches for:

- Secrets in **WaybackURLs** 
- Secrets in **JS Files**
- Secrets in **Github** for an Organistaion [Coming Soon]
- Secrets in **Swagger** [Coming Soon]
- Secrets in **Postman Collections** [Coming Soon]
