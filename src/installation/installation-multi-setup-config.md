## Add DB Connection string

In the controller VM, go to the path where you have cloned Mantis, and open local.yml within the **/configs/**.

Search for **dbConfig** in local.yml and add the connection string, then save it.

```shell
dbConfig:
  mongoConnectionString: 'PASTE CONNECTION STRING HERE'
```
