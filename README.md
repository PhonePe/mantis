# Mantis

## Summary

Mantis is a command-line framework designed to automate the workflow of asset discovery, reconnaissance, and scanning. It takes the top-level domains as input, then seamlessly progresses to discovering corresponding assets, including subdomains and certificates. The tool performs reconnaissance on active assets and concludes with a comprehensive scan for vulnerabilities, secrets, misconfigurations and phishing domains - all powered by a blend of open-source and custom tools.


## Features :rocket:

- Automated Discovery, Recon & Scan
- Distributed Scanning (split a single scan across multiple machines)
- Super-Easy Scan Customisation
- Dashboard Support
- Vulnerability Management
- Advanced Alerting
- DNS Service Integration
- Integrate new tool (existing and custom) in minutes

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Mantis supports multiple installation types. Installing Mantis via Docker would be a good start to get a hang of the framework.

Considering that Mantis also includes MongoDB and AppSmith, we have provided a shell script that installs all the components.

### Docker 

Clone the Mantis repository 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PhonePe/mantis.git
```

cd into the Mantis directory    

```
$ cd mantis/setup/docker
```

Run the respective docker setup file based on your OS

```
$ ./docker-setup-macos.sh

$ ./docker-setup-ubuntu.sh
```


### Ubuntu - Linux

To install Mantis directly on Ubuntu, follow the below steps. 

Clone the Mantis repository 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/PhonePe/mantis.git
```

cd into the Mantis directory

## Command Line Options üñ•Ô∏è

```
usage: 
        ONBOARD: (First time scan, Run this !!)

        mantis onboard -o example_org -t www.example.org
        mantis onboard -o example_org -f file.txt

        SCAN:

        mantis scan -o example_org
        mantis scan -o example_org -a example_app
            

optional arguments:
  -h, --help      list command line options

subparser:
  {onboard,scan}
    onboard       Onboard a target
    scan          Scan an org

```

```
usage: 
        SCAN:

        mantis scan -o example_org
        mantis scan -o example_org -a example_app
            

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -w WORKFLOW, --workflow WORKFLOW
                        workflow to be executed as specified in config file
  -o ORG, --org ORG     name of the organisation
  -a APP, --app APP     scan only subdomains that belong to an app
  -p, --passive         run passive port scan
  -s, --stale           mark domains as stale (domains purchased but not in use)
  -i, --ignore_stale    ignore stale domains during scan
  -r, --use_ray         use ray framework for distributed scans
  -n NUM_ACTORS, --num_actors NUM_ACTORS
                        number of ray actors, default 10
  -d, --delete_logs     delete logs of previous scans
  -v, --verbose         print debug logs

```

## Run a scan üîç

You want to onboard an org with its TLDs/IPs/IP-CIDRs/IP Range for the first time, use the onboard mode. This runs the scan on the default workflow.

#### TLD

```shell
$ mantis onboard -o org_name -t example.in   
```
#### IP

```shell
$ mantis onboard -o org_name -t 10.123.123.12
```

#### IP-Range

```shell
$ mantis onboard -o org_name -t 203.0.113.0-203.0.113.255
```

#### IP-CIDR

```shell
$ mantis onboard -o org_name -t 203.0.113.0/24
```

### Onboard Known Assets and Scan
```shell
$ mantis onboard -o org_name -f input.txt
```

### Scan on all assets belonging to an organisation

Now that you have onboarded, you just need to run scheduled scans for an org, you can just use the scan mode

```shell
$ mantis scan -o org_name
```

### Scan on all assets belonging to an organisation and app

```shell
$ mantis scan -o org_name -a app_name
```
