> We are in the beta phase of the tool and would like to know if you are facing any installation issues with our framework. If so, please post your issues on our [discord](https://discord.gg/uJV8Y3uSGu).

## Summary

Mantis is a command-line framework designed to automate the workflow of asset discovery, reconnaissance, and scanning. It takes the top-level domains as input, then seamlessly progresses to discovering corresponding assets, including subdomains and certificates. The tool performs reconnaissance on active assets and concludes with a comprehensive scan for vulnerabilities, secrets, misconfigurations and phishing domains - all powered by a blend of open-source and custom tools.


## Features :rocket:

- Automated Discovery, Recon & Scan
- Distributed Scanning (split a single scan across multiple machines)
- Super-Easy Scan Customisation
- Dashboard Support
- Vulnerability Management
- Advanced Alerting
- DNS Service Integration
- Integrate new tool (existing and custom) in minutes

[Click here](https://phonepe.github.io/mantis/features/features.html) to know more about the features in detail. 


## Modules üß∞

- Discovery
    - Subdomains
    - Certificates
- Recon
    - Open Ports
    - Technologies
    - CDN
    - WAF
    - Web Server
    - IP
    - ASN Information
    - Location
- Scan
    - Domain Level Vulnerabilities and Misconfigurations
    - Secrets Scanning
    - Phishing Domains

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Mantis supports multiple installation types. Installing Mantis via Docker would be a good start to get a hang of the framework.

Considering that Mantis also includes MongoDB and AppSmith, we have provided a shell script that installs all the components.

### Minimum System Requirements (Single Machine Scan) üñ•Ô∏è
- Supported OS: Ubuntu, macOS
- RAM - 4GB
- Cores - 2
- Storage - 16GB

> Warning üö® - The framework combines a number of open source and custom tools and runs them in parallel, hence the framework is CPU intensive and is recommended to run the framework on a dedicated VM.  
> The ``-tc`` option controls the parallel processing. If you run it from a machine with low configuration, set the -tc to 1 or 2. If you have a machine with a higher configuration, you can increase the -tc count. 

### Docker 

Setup Video - [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PCRIJEOTWo)

Clone the Mantis repository 

```
git clone https://github.com/PhonePe/mantis.git
```

cd into the Mantis directory    

```
cd mantis/setup/docker
```

Run the respective docker setup file based on your OS

```
./docker-setup-macos.sh

./docker-setup-ubuntu.sh
```

## Dashboard Setup üìä

Once the docker setup is complete, please run a scan and follow the below instructions to setup the dashboard.

> Warning üö® - Run atleast one scan before setting up dashboard using the command

```shell
mantis onboard -o org_name -t example.in   
```

- The dashboard is accessible at http://mantis.dashboard:1337
- Once you access the dashboard, create an account on AppSmith.
- Now go to base [url](http://mantis.dashboard:1337) 
- Click on 3 dots on right side of the home page and import the template from dashboard_templates folder
- You will be asked to enter db information, enter the following information:
    - host - mantis.db
    - port - 27017
    - default db - mantis

## Run a scan üîç

You want to onboard an org with its TLDs/IPs/IP-CIDRs/IP Range for the first time, use the onboard mode. This runs the scan on the default workflow.

#### TLD

```shell
mantis onboard -o org_name -t example.in   
```
#### IP

```shell
mantis onboard -o org_name -t 10.123.123.12
```

#### IP-Range

```shell
mantis onboard -o org_name -t 203.0.113.0-10
```

#### IP-CIDR

```shell
mantis onboard -o org_name -t 203.0.113.0/24
```

### Onboard Known Assets and Scan
```shell
mantis onboard -o org_name -f input.txt
```

### Scan on all assets belonging to an organisation

Now that you have onboarded, you just need to run scheduled scans for an org, you can just use the scan mode

```shell
mantis scan -o org_name
```

### Scan on all assets belonging to an organisation and app

```shell
 mantis scan -o org_name -a app_name
```
